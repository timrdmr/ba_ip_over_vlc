# Evaluation of a Low-cost IP over VLC System for the IoT

## Bachelorthesis Artifacts

This repository is the starting point to find all artifacts implemented for the bachlor thesis.

A fork of the RIOT OS project with low-cost VLC link layer is in progress and will be also linked here soon.
In the meanwhile, you can find the two modules in this repository.
The link layer implementation is in the folder `vlc_netif` and the physical layer in the folder `vlc_physical_layer`.
